This project adds content dynamically by reading an array of objects with content.

It implements an event listener for the "scroll" event, which calculates which section is the one closest to the top of the page so it can be shown in the topic list.

When clicking at an item in the list, the site scrolls to the corresponding section.

Each section is collapsed on first load.

Each section has a delete button, which removes the section from the content parent.

At the bottom, there is a "Go To Top" text button.
